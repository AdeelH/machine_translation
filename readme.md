German-to-English machine translation using a Transformer and pre-trained GloVE embeddings. (Class project, Deep Learning for NLP, CS690D, Spring 2019)

The Transformer is implemented from scratch in PyTorch. Due to computational limitations, only 4 layers of encoders and decoders are used. Pre-trained GloVE embeddings are used for both English and German. The model achieves a BLEU score of 21.6.
